This occurs because the editor is still in the process of initializing\n *\t  when the component decides to destroy it. This semaphore waits for the editor to fully initialize before destroying it, thereby\n *\t  allowing a new instance of the editor to be attached to the specified element.\n *\n *\t* Rapid mounting and unmounting in strict mode frequently results in the `editor-source-element-already-used` exception\n *\t  being thrown by the editor. This is due to React reusing the underlying DOM element during the mounting and unmounting of components\n *\t  (especially if the same component is being mounted and unmounted). Consequently, a race condition arises. The first render begins to\n *\t  attach the editor (in async mode), and shortly thereafter, it is destroyed and a new instance of the component is initialized.\n *\t  This semaphore, by utilizing a static semaphores promises map, retains information about whether the element is used by a previous\n *\t  instance of the editor and resumes execution when it is freed.\n *\n *\t* The process involves starting up many editors that are no longer needed and are immediately removed in the following rerenders.\n *\t  This can cause the editor’s initialization performance to slow down. The initialization of the editor is skipped when numerous\n *\t  rerenders occur within a short time-frame while using this semaphore. An example of this could be a situation with 4 rerenders\n *\t  occurring within a 10ms period. This semaphore will likely batch these calls, and instead of initializing 4 editors, only 2 will be\n *\t  initialized (the first and the last one).\n */\nexport class LifeCycleElementSemaphore<R> {\n\t/**\n\t * This is a map of elements associated with promises.
